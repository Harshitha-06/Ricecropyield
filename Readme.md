# Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

![Rice Leaf Disease Detection](images/rice_leaf_detection.jpg)

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on detecting diseases in rice leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system analyzes leaf images and classifies them into different disease categories, helping farmers take timely actions.

## ✨ Features
✅ Automatic detection of rice leaf diseases
✅ Deep learning-based classification using CNN
✅ High accuracy in disease prediction
✅ Easy-to-use model for real-world applications
✅ Scalable for other crop diseases

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased rice leaves. It is preprocessed and augmented before training.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize, augment images).
2. Train a CNN model on labeled leaf images.
3. Test the model on unseen images.
4. Predict and classify rice leaf diseases.
5. Display results with confidence scores.
